        <h3><i>What is the fundamental difference between the data discussed in Chapter 7 and the data discussed in Chapter 8?</i></h3>
        <p>The data that was seen in chapter 7 involved the numbers and information that went into the graphs. For example, one of the topics discussed was standard deviation, which is the number to determine a data point's deviation from the mean. The data in chapter 8 discusses trends and patterns in the data over a certain period of time. For example, one of the definitions given is <b>trend</b> which is how variables change (up/down/stay the same) during the time segment being explored.</p>

        <h3><i>What are the pros and cons of 3 visualizations techniques discussed in Chapter 8?</i></h3>
        <p>One of the visualization techniques discussed in this chapter is logarithmic scale. The pros of this is that it can display the information on a graph so that people can see the rate of change of each time period. The cons are that they don't give a clear idea of the overall change rate. Another visualization technique is the time series. The pro of this is that when there are many data points, it is very useful to see how things increase/decrease over a long period of time. The con is that they can mislead easily since gaps in data can be ignored. Another technique is the horizontal chart. A pro of this is that its use of positive and negative valyes mean that chart can be much shorter. The con is that to be easily understood, more design work shoudl be put onto colors and other aesthetic choices.</p>
